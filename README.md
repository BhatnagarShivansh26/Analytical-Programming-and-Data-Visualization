# Analytical-Programming-and-Data-Visualization
This Analytics explores how air pollution and emissions affect heart health, analyzing trends since 2000 across states. It shows links between pollution, emissions, and cardiovascular diseases using data analytics and visuals. The goal is to guide policies and strategies to reduce risks from industrial pollution on public health.


This report is based on three separate datasets—Pollution, 
Heart Care and Hospitals, and Emissions—integrating their 
interrelationships and connections with health, environmental 
quality, and socioeconomic variables. We Aimed to Analyze 
and Visualize a Dashboard to show the Impact of the 
Emission of Different types of fuel, demonstrate which 
sectors are contributing to these emissions then analyze the 
yearly/seasonal trend of air pollution in the same US states to 
show what the factors that are contributing in Air Quality 
Index (Just Like O3 Mean, CO3 Level) then We have 
performed comprehensive analytics of Healthcare dataset and 
got insights of Cardiovascular Health. And presented how 
Environmental pollution and emissions contribute to the 
Cardiovascular health of people in the USA.  
The novel Questions we are solving are stated below:- 
The research seeks to answer the following questions: 
• What are the trends in air pollution from the 2000s, 
and how do they correlate with emissions data? 
• Can patterns in heart health data reveal associations 
between pollution levels and cardiovascular 
diseases? Ease of Use.
